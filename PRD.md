# UTD Gym Traffic Tracker: Product Requirements Document

## 1. Introduction

The UTD Gym Traffic Tracker is a web application designed for students at the University of Texas at Dallas. The primary purpose of this app is to help students make informed decisions about when to visit the campus gyms by providing visual data on historical, current, and predicted traffic levels. The application is inspired by the design and utility of the UTDGrades platform, which is widely used by students.

## 2. Goals

### Primary Goal
Provide UTD students with an easy-to-use tool to view gym traffic and plan their workouts, thereby reducing wait times and improving the overall gym experience.

### Secondary Goal
Build a functional, aesthetically pleasing, and user-friendly web application using vibe coding principles.

### Future Goal
To be a proof-of-concept for a full-scale application that could potentially be integrated into the official UTD system using real-time swipe card data.

## 3. Target Users

### Primary Users
- **UTD Students**: The primary users who are looking to work out at one of the two main campus gyms.

### Secondary Users
- **Campus Staff**: Potential secondary users who may want to monitor gym usage for resource management and planning.

## 4. Key Features

### 4.1. Gym Selection
The application will allow users to select and view data for two distinct locations:
- **Activity Center**
- **Rec Center West**

### 4.2. Data Visualization & Display
- A central display area will show graphical representations of gym traffic.
- The layout will be inspired by UTDGrades, featuring a sidebar for navigation (e.g., selecting gyms, dates) and a main content area for graphs.
- The data will be displayed in one of three modes, based on the selected date:
  - **Current Usage**: A live or near-live view of the number of people currently in the gym. (For this project, this will be simulated data).
  - **Historical Data**: A historical view showing traffic patterns for past dates and times.
  - **Predicted Usage**: A predictive model showing expected traffic for future dates and times, based on historical trends (e.g., peak hours on Mondays, weekend trends).

### 4.3. Interactive Elements
- **Light/Dark Mode Switch**: A prominent toggle switch (sun/moon icon) will allow users to change the application's theme. The light and dark modes will be designed for optimal readability.
- **Form Submission**: Users will be able to select specific days and times to view data. (This is a core interactive feature).

## 5. Technical Stack (Initial Plan)

### Frontend Technologies
- **HTML**: Structure and semantic markup
- **CSS**: Styling and layout
- **JavaScript**: Interactivity and data manipulation

### Styling Framework
- **Tailwind CSS**: For a modern, responsive design

### Data Management
- **Simulated Data**: Objects or arrays will be used to represent gym traffic

### Visualization Libraries
- **Charting Library**: A charting library will be used for the data visualizations, similar to the bar chart in UTDGrades

## 6. Future Considerations

### Real-time Data Integration
The ultimate goal is to integrate with the UTD system to pull actual student swipe card data for real-time gym traffic monitoring.

### Scalability
- Potential expansion to include more campus facilities
- Integration with UTD's official student portal
- Mobile application development

### Advanced Features
- Push notifications for optimal workout times
- Social features (workout buddy finder)
- Integration with fitness tracking apps

## 7. Constraints and Limitations

### Current Phase
- Simulated data only (no real-time integration)
- Limited to two gym locations
- Web-only application (no mobile app)

### Technical Constraints
- Must work across major browsers
- Should be responsive for various screen sizes
- Must maintain accessibility standards
